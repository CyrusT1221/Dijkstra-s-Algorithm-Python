**Dijkstra's Algorithm Implementation in Python**

This repository contains a Python implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path in a weighted graph. Dijkstra's algorithm efficiently computes the shortest paths from a single source vertex to all other vertices in a graph with non-negative edge weights.

**Features:**

1. **Efficient Algorithm**: Implements Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest paths in a weighted graph.

2. **Customizable**: Easily adaptable to different graph representations and input formats.

3. **Clear Implementation**: Provides a clear and concise implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm in Python.

**Usage:**

1. **Input Graph**: Define the graph as an adjacency matrix or list of lists, where graph[i][j] represents the weight of the edge from vertex i to vertex j. Use 0 to represent absence of edges.

2. **Run Algorithm**: Call the dijkstra(graph, start) function, where graph is the input graph and start is the index of the starting vertex.

3. **Output**: The algorithm prints the shortest distance from the starting vertex to each vertex in the graph, along with the previous vertex in the shortest path.
